*Unfinished Pose*

Checked-in disrobed again anew.  

Footing finding,  
taut—steady,  
flesh over drape,  
sketch a gust  

steps,  
reaches—  
a flash below,  
shadow splits haze,  
stand strong crouch low    

glasses drop,  
nose skin dents,  
from a play to sting—  
words brushed too thin,  
steps a teetering 
spoken chevron  
  
but holds still asks - none - the - less  
'what do you see?'  
  
not enough resistance, definition  
  
foot falls,  
flashes fade,  
declines soft—  
impasse underpass,  
silence slips,  
unsaid shuts  
  
they stand,  
that nose,  
that pose—  
that breaking span,  
cleaved city cuts  

what is left   
but clumsy marks  
what is lean  
but a crude word    
  
we say goodbye but drew farewell
