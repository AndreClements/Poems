*Pose Unfinished, Final*

Checked-in disrobed again anew.  

Footing finding,  
taut—steady,  
flesh over drape,  
sketch a gust  

steps,  
reaches—  
a flash below,  
shadow splits haze,  
stand strong crouch low    

glasses drop,  
nose skin dents,  
from a play to sting—  
words brushed too thin,  
steps a teetering 
spoken chevron  
  
but holds still - none - the - less  
  
foot falls,  
flashes fade,  
declines soft—  
impasse underpass,  
silence slips,  
unsaid shuts  
  
they stand,  
that nose,  
that pose—  
that breaking span,  
cleaved city cuts  

what is left   
our clumsy marks  
what is lean  
my crude words    
  
we say goodbye
