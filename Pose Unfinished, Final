Footing finding,
taut—steady,
flesh over crete,
tight a gust

steps,
reaches—
a flash below,
shadow splits haze,
stance somewhere low  

glasses drop,
nose skin dents,
from a play to sting—
words brushed thin,
steps a teeter,
spoken chevron

but holds still none the less

foot falls,
flashes fade,
declines soft—
impasse underpass,
silence slips,
unsaid shuts

they stand,
that nose,
that pose—
that breaking span,
like city cuts

what is left 
clumsy marks
what is lean
crude words  

we say goodbye
