*Unfinished Pose*

_Checked-in again, disrobed anew._  

She steps bare,  
footing finds—flesh taut,  
her curves brim lush wealth,  
steel creaks in hush,  
words brace too frail,  
gesture tilts at a start—  
a care too slight  
  
Observations trace her arc,  
steps stretch—skin flares,  
sheer parts sight’s veil,  
truss gleams—tense bite,  
a flash cuts below,  
clumsy honesty shears too bright—  
a hold too tight  
  
She holds—asks low,  
his glasses slip, nose dents,  
“what of the shapes of me?”—  
truth bends, tone drifts,  
like a blade’s gleam splits the dark,  
words become chevron scars,  
span fails unblessed  
  
Smudges fade her lines,  
foot falls—pose frays soft,  
silence sifts through steel,  
shame drifts at once now back,  
resignation seams so slow,  
a gift gleams misplaced or lost—  
some scars turn light  
  
She stays but only in her trace,  
that nose, that poise—etched fine,  
marks ache in subtle fade,  
city’s cuts a sign,  
what’s left but words  
drawn from a bitter well—  
we say goodbye—draw farewell
